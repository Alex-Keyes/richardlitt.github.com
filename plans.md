Student Research workshop (ACL): 

* Maltese Morphosyntactic Resource development
* Simulating Language Acquisition paper

Possible demos (ACL, NAACL):  

* Kelmu - Maltese / adapatable dictionary app  
* Glossy  - online interface for text lexicons  
* Eana Eltu - Online, translatable dictionary system  

I am not sure how much demonstrations should be presentations of tools
and resources. 

Papers (ACL): 

* Maltese morphological analysis
* Maltese chunker?
