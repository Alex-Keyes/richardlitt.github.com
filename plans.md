These are here because it seems the best place for them to be. Feel free
to comment on any thing. 

### Plans that aren't conferences

 * Late January - Examinations
 * Late February/Early March - US Trip for ICLDC, possible stops in San
   Francisco, Washington State, and Washington DC. 
 * April - German, France trip for [Festival Frontieres](http://www.festivalfrontieres.blogspot.com/)
 * April - move Maya from her berth in Pieta harbor
 * July - Thesis submission

somewhere to work full-time doing something else.
