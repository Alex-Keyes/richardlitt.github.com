Increasingly, I am interested in the field of Language Policy. I am constantly surprised when I am reminded of this, as it seems far too much of a social science for me - but it is true that policies that are the direct result of politicians, language speakers, special interest groups, and researchers have a profound impact on people's lives. So, I've started seeing what I can learn in this field, and below are the first efforts. As always, I am open to any collaboration. 

#####Language Policy in Central Asia

I am interested in several language areas, but Central Asia is the most prominent among them (the others being China, Malta, Northern California, the Eastern United States, and Scotland). In particular, I am interested in the history of language conflict and current policies in (the otherwise unrelated) Kurdistan, the Tarim Basin (both currently, and in the [Tocharian](language-change.html) era), and Nuristan. 

I had the privilege to review Harold Schiffman's book for the LinguistList, [Language Policy and Language Conflict in Afghanistan and Its Neighbors](http://linguistlist.org/pubs/reviews/get-review.cfm?SubID=4553348), and I hope to continue to research the area.

#####Endangered Languages and Constructed Languages

As I am an experienced [conlanger](/fun-stuff.html), I have noticed many similarities in constructed language use and policy to endangered languages, and in particular to languages which are undergoing revival. I am currently working on a manuscript describing similarities between the formation of different groups of Na'vi learners who influenced policy on the [Learn Na'vi forums](http://forum.learnnavi.org) in the early days of the language, and factions interested in preserving and recreating languages such as Cornish. Some of this work has been influenced by research by my friend from [Linguists Outside Academia](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ling-outside), [Dave Sayers](http://swansea.academia.edu/DaveSayers).

#####Economics and Linguistics

I have been compiling research for several years about the implementation of language policies regarding minority languages in linguistically diverse countries, and the affect on the speakers. This is a very broad field, but I'm hoping to sink my teeth deeper into it. I have no current plan for tentative research, here.
