This is a page for research or project ideas that I have yet to
implement. I plan to update this as I continue to think.

While there is no copyright or patent or whatnot on any of
the information here, if you're interested in any of it, do let me know,
as it is possible that I can help explain it or give out more
information, that I am already working on it privately, or that I want
to work on it with you. I am particularly open to collaborations. 

For the record, this is unrelated it [ideaotter.com](http://ideaotter.com), although I like that
place, too. 

Research Ideas
---------------

 * Does poetic language share stochastic similarities
   cross-linguistically? Use a shallow parser on some developed
languages to test. 
 * Diglossia in created languages - where do we separate loan words from
   borrowed words? This is particularly relevant for Na'vi.
 * How much do authors shift over a lifetime? Look at lexicon, tree
   complexity. 
 * What is the quantifiable distance between language contact and
   language death? How would one compute this, and what database would
be good to use?
 * Are season names correlated to geography? How about ecological terms,
   for planting, harvest, and so on?
