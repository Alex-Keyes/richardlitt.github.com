I just published an article on Medium, [How To Start A Literary Press](https://medium.com/@richlitt/how-to-start-a-literary-press-2ecdf0c92b6b), about my experience setting up [Word Hoard Press](http://wordhoardpress.com). 

I like Medium's formatting better than this, my own blog, so go read it there.

Follow [@WordHoardPress](http://twitter.com/wordhoardpress), too!
