I've had two new publications published recently. 

 * Richard Littauer, Sean G. Roberts, James Winters, Rachael Bailes, Michael Pleyer, Hannah Little (2014). *From the Savannah to the Cloud: Blogging Evolutionary Linguistics Research*. In: L. McCrohon, B. Thompson, T. Verhoef, H. Yamauchi, eds., *The Past, Present and Future of Language Evolution Research: Student Volume of the 9th International Conference on the Evolution of Language*, pp.121-132. Tokyo, Japan: Evolang 9 Organizing Committee. [bib](https://www.burntfen.com/publications/bib/LittEvoC.bib)  
 * Richard Littauer, Boris Villazon-Terrazas, Steven Moran (2013). [Linguistic Resources Enhanced with Geospatial Information](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-5508). In: C. Chiarcos, P. Cimiano, T. Declerck, J. McCrae, eds., *Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2013): Representing and linking lexicons, terminologies and other language data*, pp. 53-58. Pisa, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics. [bib](https://www.burntfen.com/publications/bib/LittLDL.bib)  

I'm pretty proud of both of them. The first is a description of what we're doing over at [Replicated Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com), and how we hope the field of linguistics and academic research can change. I haven't posted much there recently, but it's a good overview of academic blogging in general.

The second is a really cool test study of the power of linked data to map out GIS, and how we can use this in Linguistics.
