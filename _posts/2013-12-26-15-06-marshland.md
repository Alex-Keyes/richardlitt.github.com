Alright.

The fabric of the world has snagged.

The miasma bubbles up from the rotting vegetation.

We float upon the tender grasses lifted by the marsh. Our sneakers grow wet with mud and pond water. We are collapsing in the runoff.

Beneath our feet, the frog eggs drape the front of our sunk canoe like a shroud. Soon, they too will bloom, like the lady slippers on the near bank.

An old woodpecker taps at the dead log, pointing up like an old man towards heaven.

Snag. Snag. And snag again.

“And is this not the essential function of the art, to add something if possible to the sum total of pleasure and form in a world where so much is subtracted by pain, confusion, and fear.”

I return to romp the swamp again, and find my boots have stuck in years-old mud. Spears litter the littoral spread, like carrots on a trencher. Their gnawed tips grey.
