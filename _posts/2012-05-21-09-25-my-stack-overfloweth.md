From Psalm 23. By me and Jolene. 

The Lord is my sysadmin, I shall not grep. 
He makes me use languages with many libraries,
he allows me to apt-get many packages, 
he clears my cache. 
He echoes my global path, 
for his user names klout. 
Even though I tech-support other people's code, 
I will fear no project manager, 
for you are with me; 
your root access and your admin powers,
they comfort me.
You oai-pmh my repository,
in the presence of my 4chan trolls.
You chmod my files as 777,
my stack overfloweth.
Surely your goodness and wireless network will follow me
all the days of my life,
I will subscribe to your mailing list
for(int days = 0; days <= eternity; days++);
I will be in your usergroup.
