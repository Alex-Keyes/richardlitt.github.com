I've been working hard at some other projects the past two days (one of
which is re-reading all of [the Wheel of
Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) before *A Memory
of Light*, the last book, comes out), but I have also managed to fill in
a few more pages. 

One is the [Projects](/projects.html) page, where I give a brief list of
projects I am currently involved with elsewhere on the web - most
notably, [Unexus](http://unexus.org), [Wyrd In](http://wyrdin.com), and
[IdeaOtter](http://ideaotter.com). I've also filled out the [Language
Development](/language-resource-dev.html) Projects page, where I talk
about [CLARIN](http://de.clarin.eu), and
[Kelmu](https://github.com/RichardLitt/lrl/tree/master/Maltese) and my
Learn Na'vi projects, like [translating
Facebook](https://github.com/RichardLitt/keypuk-ninavi) into a language
only a couple of dozen people can actually speak semi-fluently. 

If you're interested in collaboration, because you want to go to Sofia,
too, let me know. I'm just a click or two away.
