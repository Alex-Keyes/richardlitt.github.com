I've been working hard at some other projects the past two days (one of
which is re-reading all of [the Wheel of Time]() before *A Memory of
Light*, the last book, comes out), but I have also managed to fill in a
few more pages. 

One is the [Projects](/projects.html) page, where I give a brief list of
projects I am currently involved with elsewhere on the web - most
notably,
[Unexus](http://unexus.org), [Wyrd In](http://wyrdin.com), and
[IdeaOtter](http://ideaotter.com). I've also filled out the [Language
Development](/language-resource-dev.html) Projects page, where I talk
about [CLARIN](de.clarin.eu), and
[Kelmu](http://www.github.com/RichardLitt/lrl/Maltese) and my Learn
Na'vi projects, like translating Facebook into a language only a couple
of dozen people can actually speak semi-fluently. 

I've also written a [Plans](/plans.html) page, where I list the
deadlines for conferences I want to go to. This is more for me, than for
you, as it is going to now be my go-to for figuring out when I have
deadlines for conferences and travel. I travel a lot, and I need a
central place to keep track of what I submit where and when to do that,
so here that is. Hopefully, I won't go to as many conferences as I did
this year, but I already have a few lined out for submission - and at
least one, the [ICLDC](nflrc.hawaii.edu/ICLDC/2013/) in Hawai'i,
confirmed. I'll be presenting on a tool for scraping Facebook Groups to
make language corpora there, something I am going to talk about at more
length as soon as I get the Research pages up. For now, conferences you
might see me at, hopefully, this year are:

* [ACL 2013](acl2013.org) in Sofia, Bulgaria  
* [NAACL-HLT 2013](http://naacl2013.naacl.org/) in Atlanta, Georgia, US  
* [STaPS](http://staps.stuts.eu/?page_id=271) in Heidelberg, Germany  
* [FSMNLP](http://fsmnlp2013.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in St. Andrews,
  Scotland  
* [ALT 10](http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_ALT10/) in
  Leipzig, Germany

If you're interested in collaboration, because you want to go to Sofia,
too, let me know. I'm just a click or two away.
