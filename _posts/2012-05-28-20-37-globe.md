After the Marathon, we came to the Globe. 

The Globe. is awesome. 

There is a really nice selection of books in the bookstore. There are
lots of pamphlets and cool things to look at. Myself, I bought _what
matters most is how well you walk through the fire_ by Bukowski.
Depressing, but good reading.

The back bit has a really nice menu, complete with Spinach burgers and
Nachos, both of which I tried. I had becherovka, a Czech drink, which,
as my friend put it, has 'the taste of Christmas and gasoline.' You
know, he wasn't wrong. The Mexican coffee, with Kahlua, is also
fantastic. At Czech prices, we've been here all day. I spent most of
that reading a paper on the [Munji language in Afghanistan](http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4506/beyer_beck.pdf?sequence=1) (very fun), and a lot of
[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality] (hpmor.com) (more fun). Smoking is cool inside, and
the music ain't half bad. Before - James Bond themes. Now - Fatboy Slim.

Wireless is excellent. 
Plugs are good. 
Chairs are comfortable.

And once again I sacrifice seeing another city for happiness.
