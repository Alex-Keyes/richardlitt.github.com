With Andreas and Lemar in the Marathon Café in Prague. I've continually
wanted to start a blog talking about all of the different cafés I've
been to, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. As this blog as so easy
to push, this post is going here, although it may eventually go on a new
blog, or maybe even on my old [Edinburgh
Cafes](http://www.edinburghcafes.blogspot.com) blog, which is really only for
cafes in Edinburgh.

So, here's the run down:

 * Two cute girls in the corner
 * In a confusing building - might be a uni?
 * Wireless good. Also, access to Eduroam as a backup.
 * Latte alright, a bit too frothy.
 * Very lovely music, computer near the door for selection. Conducive to
   sitting and thining. Think lounge music, but not so ungood. 
 * Chairs, nice. Lights, nice. General atmosphere: chic. 
 * Food - not sure, haven't had it. Going to another place now.
 * Many outlets for computers.

Rating: 4 out of 5.
