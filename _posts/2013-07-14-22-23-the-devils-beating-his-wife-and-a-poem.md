_Here are some excerpts from a journal entry in New York._

---

Americana calls me in. She spits out cliches - "Regular food for regular people" - and makes me want her anyway. So, here I sit, 7:00 at night, waiting for a Daft Punk imitation gig, at a Diner in a city of endless coffee options. The coffee isn't that bad; but I think of epithets for it. "Great for sharpening teeth," or, "Cure for Athlete's foot - apply liberally." I cover my stale fries in mayo. The pouring rain applauds.

An old man approaches the waitress. "Do me a favor - when the check comes, only me."  

A city is a million cities. The boundaries bleed into each other. We've given a name to an idea, an abstraction to maintain cohesiveness. There is no New York - legislative zones are protocols for the real thing, a multiplicity of conceptualizations. 8 million spirits.  

"I wonder if the souls passing through the windows of the hospitals and sick beds to heaven get mangled in the AC unit," I said, at three am.

"Do you want to get married," she asks, curious.  
"A few times," I reply. "I guess I've never valued the sanctity of marriage."

Outside, the devil's beating his wife. Who was she, I wonder? What was she like? Did they meet one fine morning? What did his sweet-blooded lips promise here? Did he reek of bourbon, even then? Did she wear a white dress at the wedding? Did she, bare-assed, make eggs in the morning, the pan spitting drops of oil on his borrowed, Swedish sweater? Did she love him back for his cleverness? Did she once enjoy his company? Does she sit on the veranda on summer evenings and wait for him to come home? What was her name?

Morsi, go firmly to the window and listen! What God abandons me now? What crowds cheer for me? What invisible procession?

Trying to find a path   
through the forest of bloodshot trees  
set against the cloudy sclerae of your eyes.  
Your pupil is a lunar eclipse.  
Behind that black disc  
you've got stars in your eyes.

Just had breakfast with [redacted]. She woke me up at around 7 with incessant pleas.  
"Everything is happening!"  
"Not me."
