Well, I think I might be getting some of the hang of it. I'm not sure
how to remove the tagline yet, but I'll get there eventually. I do like
the way that YAML works, and using Markdown files instead of anything
else. I do tend to the Spartan, though - I could use the Wordpress
wysiwyg much easier than .md, but I approach .md with a better sense of
mind because I feel like I should be able to do more with it. That's
probably not actually the case. I suspect I prefer it for some prestige
reason.

In any event, I'm going to see if I can push to this directly. So, next
up, set up a symbolic link, and a small python program - a shell
program? - to allow me to edit the markdown file as soon as I rake it,
and then to commit and push it as soon as that is over. Hypothetically,
that'll mean a lot easier quick blogging than what I have at the moment,
which is nothing. Wordpress is very heavy, twitter doesn't do enough,
Faebook is the wrong audience, I don't use G+ for some reason
(distractions? Wide margins? The multiplicity of colours?). But this
should do nicely, if only I can manage it, retain my sanity, and always
have the internet on me. 

That's all for now.
