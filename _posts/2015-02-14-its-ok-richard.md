It’s ok. 

Richard, it’s OK. 

If you’d rather sit in a cafe and solve interesting problems, working with brilliant people making the world a better place, you can do that. You don’t have to go to a cafe on the other side of the city because you said you wanted to go to a cafe on the other side of the city earlier in the day. You don’t even have to go outside. If you want to work, work.
