#Computational Linguistics

These are examination preparation notes from the slides for a course I took at the University of Saarland in Saarbr√ºcken in the summer of 2012. The majority of the information here came from the slides for that course, which are available online, but not under any copyright. To save embarassment in case I mistype or misunderstood, I won't cite the lecturers here. Much of this information can be found in better quality in Dan Jurafsky or Chris Mannings books, cited below.
