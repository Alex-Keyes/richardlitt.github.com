I sit down at my work station, open up my laptop with stickers on it from Dinosaur Comics, go downstairs and back again with a fresh free Bluebottle coffee, say hello to some of the coworkers in the office today, take off my new dinner jacket I wore today because I wanted to imagine that the side glances on the subway are for a good reason and not a bad one, call my senator briefly to complain about the NSA, open up the issues on Github related to Angular and the Ideapod front end, put on "Closer than This" on Spotify by St. Lucia, and think to myself; this is the life. 

```
git add all_these_thoughts
git commit -am "25th Birthday Post, short and to the point"
git push origin master
