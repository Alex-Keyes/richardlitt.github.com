I ran across this email from Reuters in my inbox today. [Romney opens new front vs Obama: schools are failing](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/24/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE84H13020120524?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews)

What shall I think of this? My first thought was _Good, I'm glad that is
being talked about._ This was followed almost immediately by _Romney
must be an OK guy to bring this up, as it is important. Maybe I should
reconsider calling him an asshole before I actually look at his issues,
just based on his party and what I remember of his assinine comments in
the primaries._ 

Of course, I then realised that this, too, is wrong. There are two
biases playing out here: one being a cognitive bias, and the other being
the bias of the news team. To understand, consider these questions:  

 * How do we know that Romney actually cares?
 * Are failing schools in any way connected to Romney?
 * Has Obama not being doing enough for schools?
 * If he has been doing stuff, then why is this a new front?
 * Why is Romney seemingly on the offensive here? Even the language
   suggests it.
 * How, on earth, is this a _new_ front? Surely schools have been
   failing America for decades?

Basic point: Be very careful what you think after reading a headline.
You're probably wrong, at first.
