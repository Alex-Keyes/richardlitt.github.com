I ran this twitter account to build hype for Valyrian, a language from GRR Martin's _Game of Thrones_. A few months after creating it, it was announced that David Peterson would create it for the HBO series, and I subsequently closed the account.

This is somewhat related to my [Dothraki](../dothraki) and [Na'vi](../learn-navi) work.
