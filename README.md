The B/og
======================

This is my personal blog and project website. It is also similar to a
lab notebook, in some regards - I post here projects that I am doing,
and those that I am working on. My hope is that eventually this will be
the go-to place for information about all of the work I end up doing. 

My other website, the [Burnt Fen](http://www.burntfen.com), is more of a
link repository, and should be phased out in time. I find that it is not
ideal for going in depth about certain projects, although it does work
well as a snapshot of who I am, in some regards. 

Everything I put on the internet is dynamic and open to change. For now,
this is how things are here.

differently (which, as far as I can forsee, shouldn't happen).
