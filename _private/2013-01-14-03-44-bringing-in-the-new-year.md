Last year, I tried to [summarise 2011](http://www.burntfen.net/merecat/?p=587) with a collection of images that I thought had constituted the year for me. I liked that. Here it is, for this year. First, the story line. 

---

I came back from Scotland, where I spent New Years reading 'The Wizard Knight' and watching fireworks from the flat while Robert and everyone was out at the party. I spent the next few months settling in, as far as I can recall. I know there were exams, and examination stress, and resits, and that I spent a lot of time with Jolene, my girlfriend then. 

I took a trip to Japan, to Tokyo, and then a day-hitch to Kyoto. I was incredibly fatigued from travelling and jet-lag and the large conference I went to about evolutionary linguistics, but I loved it. Those experiences will stay with me, for a long time. I somehow managed to publish a ridiculous amount in 2012. 

I hitched to EACL, in Avignon, where I presented a paper that my coauthors and I had written at short noticed because I wanted to go. I stayed with some great couch surfers, and left early to hitch to Geneva, where I got to see my sister and cuñado again. I took the train home from there - my reimbursement receipts looked interesting. I worked some more. At some point, I went to Nijmegen for an invited talk at the department on workflow research, and I got flown by the LAGB to be the represenative at the second ULAB conference in Bristol. It was a pleasure to be there, not just because I was there the November prior, but because it was good to see my friends and how far along ULAB had come. 

I took a surprise weekend trip to Paris to see my sister, who had to go alone after Sam went to Brazil instead. I had courses, too, I guess. I went to Prague for the EMLCT graduations, and to Stuttgart for a student conference. It was around then I started liking Germany. In June, I went to Groningen for a short workshop, and to Prague again for the Erasmus Mundus Alumni Association General Meeting, where I met a whole new group of fun, interesting people who are highly motivated and made me much more excited about Europe and my time here. 

I came back. More exams, and I had to miss a conference in Hamburg. I went to Frankfurt a few times. My friend Brian came to visit me from Afghanistan, and my friends Bec and Jamie from Iceland. I took a volunteer job helping out at the club behind my house, which turned into a magical forested happening for a weekend. I attended a secret party beneath an old bridge, and met some more great people that made me not want to leave. I bought a yacht, with Brian's help. I took a few day drips, to Metz and Nancy. 

I packed up and hitched south with Jonathan. He left at Frieburg, so I went onto Geneva, again. I stayed for a while, won a treasure hunt. Then I hitched south, through the alps, to Genoa. I took a ferry to Palermo, and took a bus to Agrigento. Trying to hithc to Licata, I met some young interns on a community project, and we proceeded to hang out for a few days, and for the next few weeks on and off. I got to Maya, my boat. I painted her, put her in the water, and welcomed my couchsurfing friend Rafik. Together, with some local help, we lived in the harbor, and learned to sail her. We travelled about Sicily a bit, had a grand time in the sun, and talked about projects. One day, we left early, and sailed off. 

I got seasick, and landed in Gozo, in Malta. We sailed Maya down the coast a bit more, until we got to Mistra Bay, where we left her. I hung around the island. Rafik and I parted ways. I made some new friends in Malta, and prepared to settle down. Then I flew to Saarbrücken again, for a meeting. I helped the programme get funding for the next five years, and saw some friends. I trained to Delft, where I met my Wired In startup team: Alin, Penio, Matěj, Swayam, and Hakan. We talked about the project. I talked to Justin, and agreed to be part of Unexus. 

I tried to hitch out to Geneva on my birthday, but I didn't have the money. I spent the day with Boris in Tilburg. I trained to Paris, broke and roofless. I made some new friends, saw some old ones, and hitched to Geneva the next day. I stayed with my sister for a bit. I then hitched north, taking a break near Erfurt to soak in my favourite part of Germany, the rural havens where plums still grow. I hitched to Leipzig, met up with an old lover, went to a conference with the Open Knowledge people. Then I used mitfahrgelegenheit to get back to Saarbrücken. I had one of the best nights of my life. I flew back to Malta the next day, and almost missed my train. 

I started courses, and hung out with the Erasmus kids for a while. I published more, and saw my name in print in a poetry book for the first time. I had an accident with the boat, and sorted it out. Brian and Todd came to visit me, although I was too scared to take them out sailing. I met Alicia. I worked some more, on different projects. 

I flew to Turin, and took the train to Bern after seeing the city. I attended a conference, and left early one day on a whim to be with my sister in Geneva for Thanksgiving. I hitched north to Saarland, again, for a few days, and flew out, again, on a whim. 

I attended more courses, made music with Jan and Dan. I worked a lot. I read a lot. I read all of the Wheel of Time, for instance. I grew inward, and forgot my last drink. 

I flew to London to be with my brother-in-law and sister, again, and Sam had forgotten to get a visa, so it turned into just Carrie. She stayed for a day. I spent Christmas with my friend Marcus there. I megabussed north, and saw Edinburgh again. I found a great cafe, and went to a party with Hamish. I spent New Years at Emmas, drunk and alive, waking up at 5 to do the dishes and stare out at the dawn on white-topped mountains, fields covered in red and green grass.

None of the above does the year justice. It was so massive. I saw so much, and went so many places. I fulfilled life long dreams - a long term girlfriend, requited love, publications, my own company(ies), my own boat, adding the  'poet' to my list of definitions. 

So, here, again, is a short list of small memories, images.
