I do a lot of things. Sometimes I make things, and other times I am a
member of groups of people who do things. Sometimes the output is art,
other times code, and other times research papers. 

It is very hard to keep track of all of my things. That is actually the
entire reason I first made [Burnt Fen](http://www.burntfen.com) - to
keep track of the tracks I leave all over the web. Sadly, Burnt Fen is
*no longer enough*. It is now more of a portal to things I have done on
the web, which is great, and it does an ok job of that. This might do a
better job, although I don't think it'll scale well. We'll see.

Here is a list of things I do, now. I don't know how often I'll update
it. I wish it was like Github, where repositories that have been edited
recently drift to the top. I might eventually code something like that.
For now, I provide this here, because I find that a text file on my
computer doesn't really do the job I want it to, either. Mostly because
it's not pretty enough, but also because sometimes I want people to say,
*Oh, you're doing that? Cool. You should look into *X*, or, can I help
you maybe?* I like those people.

##Research
I do a lot of research. Most of my threads of research are connected, which makes sense, but these strands are a lot less connected to each other than other people I know. That might be a bad thing - I've been told *you should focus more* a lot. Personally, I just like researching things. Here's a non-exhaustive look at the tapestry I'm trying to weave.
