If you've met me for more than just a few hours in the past few years, or if you've had the misfortune of living with me, you know that I sing. All of the time. Mostly in the shower, but really all of the time. I once tried to sing without repeating myself, and I think I managed around 36 hours of non-repetitive songs. I've memorised quite a few. As you might also know about me, I love making lists. So, for the past month and a half, every time I sing a song that I've memorized completely, I've tried to write it down here.
