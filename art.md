I like art quite a lot. I like making it, too. 

###Auditory

I have a selection of songs that I've written and sung on my
[Soundcloud](soundcloud.com/richard-littauer), along with a lot of
spoken poetry and more spoken-word-type things. I used to perform with
[Simon](http://simon.vansintjan.net/) in a band called the Readers,
where we would read random stuff while playing the ukulele (my
instrument) in the background - those aren't currently online anywhere,
thankfully. My new band, with Daan Hanselmans and Jan Joachimsen, is
called [Marsalfornication](soundcloud.com/marsalfornication) - we have a
few tracks up, but are currently on hiatus, as Daan moved away. 

I like to record my poetry, and have some
[here](http://www.burntfen.net/poetry/index.html) as well as on the
Soundcloud, but my most ambitious project to date in this vein is based
around creating a story surrounding fragments of Heraclitus, the greek
philosopher. I am in no rush with this story - the current recordings
(I don't upload the text) are available [here](http://burntfen.net/heraclitus/).

###Visual 

Most of the visual stuff I do is on the net, I guess, in the
sense that I like designing websites. But I draw sometimes, too. For two
years, I had a webcomic, [the Burnt Fen
Maunderings](http://burntfen.net/comic/), which I updated thrice a week.
It gets pretty dark at times. I have illustrations scattered around that
site, including in the poetry section. [One of the comics](http://burntfen.net/themeadows.png), originally
suggested by my friend Robert, went on to get very wide circulation - a
couple of thousand posts a summer - and published in [The List](http://www.list.co.uk/). It is a
suggestion for renaming the quadrants of the Meadows park in Edinburgh
after Nintendo characters. 

###Writing

I am a constant writer, although the output isn't always creative. I am
particularly interested in writing poetry. Some of my poetry is
available online [here](http://www.burntfen.net/poetry/index.html),
although the better, newer poems are more likely to show up on this
blog. I occasionally [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/richlitt) poetry,
albeit short ones. I have published poems in the Edinburgh University
Student Newspaper, in Dharmic Angels, a book coming out with tribute
poems to Jack Kerouac, and in [Code Poems](http://code-poems.com/), of
which I am particularly proud. I have an unpublished volume, Elif
winter, which I can send to you if you're interested - I write for
friends and myself. 

I occasionally send post cards to friends. I almost never send them with
the intent of the receiver understanding the message. I take photos of
some of them before they go off, but they aren't available anywhere yet.
I'm not sure why I'm telling you this. If you're interested in
recieving one, get in touch.

Believe it or not, I've written a couple of art journalism interviews for
[Chaos Magazine](http://www.chaos-mag.com/). 

I also write short stories, vignettes, and am writing a couple of books
at the moment. If you're into writing, too, you should check out and
join my collaborative art piece with Simon and others, [The New Field](https://github.com/RichardLitt/the-new-field). 

###Other

I also make my own [t-shirts](http://burntfen.net/comic/merch/) and
hoodies, and people occasionally shock me by [buying them](http://www.redbubble.com/people/richardlitt). If you have a picture of you wearing one, send it over. Here's me skiing in one of them.

###Sailing and Adventure

Finally, I am a performance artist. Most recently, this has meant that I
have, against all greater judgment and against the suggestions of many
dozens of people, bought a yacht. I blog about what happens,
occasionally, at [The Life Emphatic](http://www.thelifeemphatic.com). I
am constantly seeking new avenues for performance art.
