###Where God Went Wrong

Hi. I'm Richard Littauer. I'm at least two things: a front-end web developer, 
and a computational linguistics student. I currently live in Germany, although
I travel a fair amount.

I've lived in Europe for 7 years - last year in Germany and Malta, and for five years in
Edinburgh, Scotland - since leaving Connecticut when I was 17. I started an
English & Classics degree in [Edinburgh Uni](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), graduated with a
degree in Linguistics, and somehow, I've ended up being a coder, anyway. 
This is my blog and central repository of information about what projects 
or research I have going on at the moment. If you want a more professional 
outlook on me, here is [my CV](/files/Littauer_CV.pdf).

I do a lot of things. Sometimes I make things, and other times I am a
member of groups of people who do things. Sometimes the output is art,
other times code, and other times writing. It is very hard to keep 
track of all of my things. That is actually the
entire reason I first made a hub-like web site - for myself, to
keep track of the tracks I leave all over the web. Now I've combined it 
with this blog, so I guess this is the central place to go to learn about me. 

You can reach this page from [rlittauer.com](http://www.rlittauer.com), [burntfen.net](http://www.burntfen.net),
[burntfen.info](http://www.burntfen.info), [richardlitt.github.io](http://richardlitt.github.io), 
and [richardlitt.github.com](http://richardlitt.github.com). Some of the stuff is still hosted elsewhere, 
if you get confused why it is suddenly burntfen.net. 

If at any point you think - *Oh, you're doing that? Cool. You should look into
doing* this*, or, can I help you maybe?* - drop me a line. Email's in the header. 

###Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes 
Regarding this site itself, I had grown increasingly tired with
Wordpress and anything that even comes close to being wysiwyg. 
Luckily, someone created [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll
Bootstrapper](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), so now I can blog suitably
without the issues of using a bloated CMS. It's also much easier to customise.

Regarding actual blogging, I'm always having this issue, when reading something, or working on my task
management program, or eating pasta - the issue being that I start
thinking. It's a dangerous thing to think, because before you know it,
you've got half a post in your mind that you swear if you just
wrote down would become a chapter in a book. The issue is you never
write these down, because no one likes soggy pasta, and everyone wants
to know how [Harry Potter and the Methods of
Rationality](http://hpmor.com/) is actually going to end. Microblogging
should alleviate this concern - I can just pop down the two paragraphs I
need to clear my mind, and move on to bigger things, like that third
book of Douglas Adam's I never actually got around to. (Edit: I have now
read all of the [Hitch-hiker's guides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams), 
and I suggest you read them too. That's where the titles of these sections are coming
from.)

###Who is this God Person Anyway?
I don't know. As I said, I'm Richard. I write about a lot of stuff on a lot of
blogs - most notably, I write for amateur evolutionary linguists on [Replicated
Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com) and I used to write for anyone interested in me on [Burnt
Fen](http://www.burntfen.net/merecat) - now I write here. 

Since you're here, it is probable that you've met me somewhere. If
you've run across me online, it's probable you did so in one of these
places:

Alternatively, it may have been through the [Undergraduate Linguistics
Association of Britain](http://www.lingstudents.co.uk/), or maybe
through the [International Association for Linguistic
Students](http://www.lingstudents.org), two organisations I co-founded
with [David Arnold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmarnold) for students
in the UK. Or perhaps you ran across some of the sites I've done web
mastery for - the [United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad](uklo.org), the
[Committee for Linguistics in Education](http://www.clie.org.uk), the
[Language Alliance](http://www.language-alliance.org.uk), the [Edinburgh
Language Ambassadors](http://ela.eusa.ed.ac.uk),
[SAIVUS](http://www.saivus.org), or the [Linguistics Society of
America](https://lsadc.org/)'s [Committee for Endangered Language
Preservation](http://lsacelp.org/), or the Committee for Student Issues
and Concerns. You may be a member of [Linguists Outside
Academia](http://groups.google.com/group/ling-outside), the [Open
Linguistics Working Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ling-outside)
or the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/), or you may be
coming from the archives of the [Edinburgh University Linguistics and
English Language](http://langsoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk), [Anime and
Animation](http://aasoc.wordpress.com/), or [Science Fiction and Fantasy
societies](http://sesoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk/), or maybe from the [UdS
Computerlinguistiks](coli.uni-saarland.de)' old
[Fachschaft](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/fs-coli/Main/HomePage)
page. You may also be coming from [Learn
Na'vi](http://www.learnnavi.org), [Learn
Dothraki](http://www.dothraki.org), or the [Language Creation
Society](http://www.conlang.org). Maybe even from [Edinburgh
Caf√©s](http://edinburghcafes.com/), or [Wired In](http://wyrdin.com),
[Ideapod](http://www.ideapod.com), [IdeaOtter](http://www.ideaotter.com),
[Octobuild](http://www.octobuild.com)... the list goes on.

If you've met me on
[Couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/richardlitt), that's
great, I hope we had the opportunity to hang out. If you're at the
[University of Malta](http://www.um.edu.mt/), of
[Saarland](http://www.uni-saarland.de/en/), or of
[Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), and you've met me, I hope we had
a good time.

If I don't know you from any of those places, or if you came from
another, I'm genuinely interested in two things; what made you read this
far, and how you got here. Send me a line!

###Well, That About Wraps It Up For God
Yes, I should say so. I'll post here when I can and want, but don't worry, I
won't ever quote Oolon Colluphid again if I can help it.

###Everything You Never Wanted to Know About Sex But Have Been Forced to Find Out.
Ironically, there is no text here, although this was one of Oolon's
best sellers.
