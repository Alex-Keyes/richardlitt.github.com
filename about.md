###Where God Went Wrong

> _The story so far. In the beginning the universe was created. This made a lot of people very unhappy and has widely been regarded as a bad move._

I've grown increasingly tired with Wordpress and anything that even
comes close to being wysiwyg. For one, I'm always having issues deciding
on a theme, how to best mark up a long document, and where to store
images of parrots. Luckily, someone created github pages and jekyll and
jekyll bootstrapper, so now I can blog suitably without the issues of
using a large blogging platform. I was about to move back to
livejournal, so this was a good time to be saved.

###Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes
Besides blogging, I'm always having this issue, when reading something,
or working on my task management program, or eating pasta - the issue
being that I start thinking. It's a dangerous thing to think, because
before you know it, you've got half a blog post in your mind that you
swear if you just wrote down would become a chapter in a book. The issue
is you never write these down, because no one likes soggy pasta, and
everyone wants to know how Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
is actually going to end. Microblogging should alleviate this concern -
I can just pop down the two paragraphs I need to clear my mind, and move
on to bigger things, like that third book of Douglas Adam's I never
actually got around to. 

###Who is this God Person Anyway?
Well, I'm Richard Littauer. I write about a lot of stuff on a lot of
blogs - most notably, I write for amateur evolutionary linguists on [Replicated
Typo](http://www.replicatedtypo.com) and for anyone interested in me on [Burnt
Fen](http://www.burntfen.net/merecat). I have a lot of projects that I
try to keep on top of, while somehow fitting in a Masters degree in
computational linguistics. Those projects, and more links to things like
twitter and @LearnValyrian, can be seen on [my
hub](http://www.burntfen.net).

###Well, That About Wraps It Up For God
Yes, I should say so. I'll post here when I can and want, but don't worry, I
won't ever quote Oolon Colluphid again if I can help it.
