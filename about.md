###Generic About

Hi. I'm Richard Littauer. I studied and researched computational linguistics in university. I live in San Francisco, where I collect climbing routes and tips on being an ascetic. I've lived in Europe for 7 years - two years in Germany and Malta, and for five years in Edinburgh, Scotland. I lived in Brooklyn for a year after that. I left Connecticut, where I grew up, when I was 17. I started an English & Classics degree in [Edinburgh Uni](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), graduated with a degree in Linguistics, and I've ended up being a coder, anyway.  

This is my blog and central repository of information about what projects
or research I have going on at the moment. I don't blog that much, so this is basically a place for links. My [Github](https://www.github.com/RichardLitt) is also pretty informative.  

I do a lot of things. Sometimes I make things, and other times I am a
member of groups of people who do things. Sometimes the output is art,
other times code, and other times writing. It is very hard to keep 
track of all of my things. That is actually the
entire reason I first made this web site - for myself, to
keep track of the tracks I leave all over the web. Now I've combined it 
with this blog, so I guess this is the central place to go to learn about me. If you want to see news articles that mentioned me because you've come here knowing they exist, go to [the Press page](http://www.burntfen.com/press).  

You can reach this page from [rlittauer.com](http://www.rlittauer.com), [burntfen.net](http://www.burntfen.net),
[burntfen.info](http://www.burntfen.info), [richardlitt.github.io](http://richardlitt.github.io), 
and [richardlitt.github.com](http://richardlitt.github.com). Some of the stuff is still hosted elsewhere, if you get confused why it is suddenly burntfen.net.  

If at any point you think - *Oh, you're doing that? Cool. You should look into
doing* this*, or, can I help you maybe?* - drop me a line. Email's in the header.  

Since you're here, you may have met me somewhere. If
you've run across me online, it's probable you did so in one of these
places:

Alternatively, it may have been through the [Undergraduate Linguistics
Association of Britain](http://www.lingstudents.co.uk/), or maybe
through the [International Association for Linguistic
Students](http://www.lingstudents.org), two organisations I co-founded
with [David Arnold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmarnold) for students
in the UK. Or perhaps you ran across some of the sites I've done web
mastery for - the [United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad](uklo.org), the
[Committee for Linguistics in Education](http://www.clie.org.uk), the
[Language Alliance](http://www.language-alliance.org.uk), the [Edinburgh
Language Ambassadors](http://ela.eusa.ed.ac.uk),
[SAIVUS](http://www.saivus.org), or the [Linguistics Society of
America](https://lsadc.org/)'s [Committee for Endangered Language
Preservation](http://lsacelp.org/), or the Committee for Student Issues
and Concerns. You may be a member of [Linguists Outside
Academia](http://groups.google.com/group/ling-outside), the [Open
Linguistics Working Group](http://groups.google.com/group/ling-outside)
or the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org), or you may be
coming from the archives of the [Edinburgh University Linguistics and
English Language](http://langsoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk), [Anime and
Animation](http://aasoc.wordpress.com/), or [Science Fiction and Fantasy
societies](http://sesoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk/), or maybe from the [UdS
Computerlinguistiks](coli.uni-saarland.de)' old
[Fachschaft](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/fs-coli/Main/HomePage)
page. You may also be coming from [Learn
Na'vi](http://www.learnnavi.org), [Learn
Dothraki](http://www.dothraki.org), or the [Language Creation
Society](http://www.conlang.org). Maybe even from [Edinburgh
Caf√©s](http://edinburghcafes.com/), or [Wired In](http://wyrdin.com),
[Ideapod](http://www.ideapod.com), [IdeaOtter](http://www.ideaotter.com),
[Octobuild](http://www.octobuild.com)... the list goes on.

If you've met me on
[Couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/richardlitt), that's
great, I hope we had the opportunity to hang out. If you're at the
[University of Malta](http://www.um.edu.mt/), of
[Saarland](http://www.uni-saarland.de/en/), or of
[Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home), and you've met me, I hope we had
a good time.  

If I don't know you from any of those places, or if you came from
another, I'm genuinely interested in two things; what made you read this
far, and how you got here. Send me a line!
