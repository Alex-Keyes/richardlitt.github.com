<p>I am rereading Lord of the Rings for the 13th time. I keep running
across new things - for instance, evidence so strong that I once would
have taken it for proof that the Entwives are in the Old Forest. As I
was reading along, I came upon this passage with new eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘There is one of my people yonder across the stream,’ he said, ‘though you may not see him.’ He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank.</p>

  <p>‘Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,’ said Haldir, ‘and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!’ He made his end of the rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and back again, as if he were on a road.</p>

  <p>‘I can walk this path,’ said Legolas; ‘but the others have not this skill. Must they swim?’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘No!’ said Haldir. ‘We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care.’</p>

  <p>When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains.</p>

  <p>He breathed with relief when he was safely across. ‘Live and learn! as my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!’</p>

  <p>When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. Rumil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep watch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slacklining has been traditionally taken to have been invented in 1983.
Tolkien published Lord of the Rings in 1954.</p>

<p>And, of course, The Fellowship crossed the Celebrant on January 17th, 3019 of the Shire Reckoning. Take that, Californians.</p>
