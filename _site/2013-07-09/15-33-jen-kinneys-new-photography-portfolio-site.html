<p>I was in New York city on June 19th for an <a href="www.ideapod.com">Ideapod</a> function, coding like a madman, pulling two 16 hour days back to back after getting off the plane from a weekend in Barcelona. I was more than a little stressed, but the presentation went by, and we got some compliments for it. Walking up the stairs towards the open bar after the applause, completely drained, this tall girl I had noticed in the crowd but didn’t know came up to me and asked, “Graham?”</p>

<p>It took my around five seconds to remember that Graham was the name I went by in high school (I switched to my first name, Richard, seven years ago), and that I knew the girl. Her name was Jen Kinney, and we hadn’t talked since I graduated half a decade ago. She had known another one of the people who spoke, and had been completely surprised to see me there as a coder, or indeed, there at all. We swapped numbers and agreed to hang out.</p>

<p>The next day, we sat down in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village for an hour. She whipped out a microphone, so there’s a recording around there somewhere (which I’ll have to get from her, and edit accordingly), and we talked about where our lives had taken us. Jen had graduated from Kingswood-Oxford and gone on to do a Photography degree at NYU, doing a few fun projects along the way. One of these was about to happen again - she was leaving in two weeks for Alaska, to make a photo documentary book about a town called Whittier. Whittier is interesting because it is only accessible by a 2.5 mile long train tunnel, it was built and largely abandoned by the military, and 85% of the town lives in one tower block. Jen had spent the summer there once, and now had a grant to go back. I agreed that that was pretty cool. She dropped in the conversation, somewhere, that she needed a website for this, too.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, a couple of short meetings at her place and at her goodbye party in Brooklyn, I’ve got her website up. I spent a bit too long trying to do a complicated jQuery thing that really wasn’t necessary, so that on the whole, it took around 10 hours to make. I still think it’s fun, if only because of her pictures. There’ll be more updates soon. Regarding the design, Jen actually had a whole .pdf of designs from Illustrator, so all I had to do was code up the site and figure out the architecture. Together, I think it works pretty well.</p>

<p>Check out her amazing photography at <a href="http://jakinney.com">jakinney.com</a>. I really suggest it.</p>
