* [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) by Ursula Le Guin.
  - This was a good book to read while travelling between Svalbard, Oslo, and Iceland, seeing as how it is set on a winter world.
* [Speaker for the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead) by Orson Scott Card.
  - After reading this, I plan to insist that that someone is a Speaker at my funeral. Incredibly moving.
* [Bridge to Terabithia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_to_Terabithia_(novel)) by Katherine Paterson.
