This is a list of books I have read in 2016. I will keep this list updated as I finish more books, throughout the year. Here is my list of [books read in 2015](http://burntfen.com/2015-12-29/books-i-read-in-2015).

* [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) by Ursula Le Guin.
  - This was a good book to read while travelling between Svalbard, Oslo, and Iceland, seeing as how it is set on a winter world.
* [Speaker for the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead) by Orson Scott Card.
  - After reading this, I plan to insist that that someone is a Speaker at my funeral. Incredibly moving.
