This is a list of books I have read in 2016. I will keep this list updated as I finish more books, throughout the year. Here is my list of [books read in 2015](http://burntfen.com/2015-12-29/books-i-read-in-2015).

* [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) by Ursula Le Guin.
  - This was a good book to read while travelling between Svalbard, Oslo, and Iceland, seeing as how it is set on a winter world.
* [Speaker for the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead) by Orson Scott Card.
  - After reading this, I plan to insist that that someone is a Speaker at my funeral. Incredibly moving.
* [Bridge to Terabithia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_to_Terabithia_(novel)) by Katherine Paterson.
* [I Could Pee On This (And Other Poems by Cats)](http://www.amazon.com/Could-Pee-This-Other-Poems/dp/1452110581) and [I Knead My Mommy: And Other Poems by Kittens](http://www.amazon.com/Knead-My-Mommy-Other-Kittens/dp/1452132917) by Francesco Marciuliano
* [Scott Pilgrim Vol I-VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim) by Bryan Lee O'Malley
* [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One) by Ernest Cline.
  - This was the most AWESOME book EVER. I immediately started listening to it again. I have now read it twice.
* [Where the Wild Things Are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are) by Maurice Sendak
* [Chronicle of a Death Foretold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_a_Death_Foretold) by Gabriel García Márquez.
  - This was a beautiful little tale.
* [A Geologist's View of Cape Cod](http://www.amazon.com/A-Geologists-View-Cape-Cod/dp/0940160390) by Arthur Strahler.
* [Welcome to the NHK (Vol I)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_N.H.K.) by Tatsuhiko Takimoto, Kendi Oiwa.
