This is a list of books I have read in 2017. I will keep this list updated as I finish more books, throughout the year. Here is my list of [books read in 2015](https://burntfen.com/2015-12-29/books-i-read-in-2015), and in [2016](2016.md).

* [Sharpe's Rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe%27s_Rifles_(novel)) by Bernard Cornwell.
* [Treasure Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island) by Robert Louis Stevenson.
* [Coffin Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27798536-coffin-road) by Peter May.
* [The Wind's Twelve Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind's_Twelve_Quarters) by Ursula K. Le Guin.
  - A fantastic read, as she always is.
* [100 Aves Argentinas](http://www.cuspide.com/9789502410142/100+Aves+Argentinas/) by Canevari Pablo, Narosky Tito.
  - More of a reference book. Saw around 1/4th of the birds mentioned in this book.
